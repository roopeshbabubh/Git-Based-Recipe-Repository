## Ingredients

Interestingly you need parts of the calf stomach to make milk. This is called lab ferment, also known as rennet. It basically splits the milk into something eatable.

Percentages are calculated based on the amount of milk that you use.

1. X Liters of cold milk. Important that it has less than 7°C.
2. 0.15% of citric acid. Dissolve it in 3.2% cold water
3. 0.04% of liquid lab-ferment. Dissolve in 1.6% cold water

**Example 1 liter of milk**

- 1 Liter of milk
- 1000ml * 0.15% = 1.5 grams of citric acid. Dissolve in 32ml cold water.
- 1000ml * 0.04% = 0.4 grams of liquid lab-ferment. Dissolve in 16ml cold water.

**Example 2 liters of milk**

- 2 Liters of milk
- 2000ml * 0.15% = 3 grams of citric acid. Dissolve in 64ml cold water.
- 2000ml * 0.04% = 0.8 grams of liquid lab-ferment. Dissolve in 32ml cold water.

## [Steps](https://github.com/hendricius/mozzarella#steps)

1. Pour milk in large pot
2. Add citric acid and stir well
3. Heat mixture to 32°C
4. Add liquid lab-ferment. Since it's coming from cow stomach it works best at close to body temperature.
5. Stir for 30 seconds
6. Let it rest for 8 minutes
7. Open the lid, the liquid should should look cheese like
8. Take a knife and cut it into 2cm tall cubes. The larger the cubes, the more liquid the cheese will be.
9. Stir everything carefully, trying to leave the cubes intact. This way the whey will come out.
10. Heat everything to 43°C
11. Pour pre-cheese into filter where whey can drop out at bottom
12. Gently touch the pre-cheese so that more whey drops out
13. Pour the whey back to the pot
14. Heat whey to 85°C
15. Take the quantity you want for 1 Mozzarella from the pre-cheese.
16. Dive the spoon in the heated whey for 5-10 seconds
17. Stretch and pour a ball of Mozzarella
18. Repeat the process one more time, that way you can better stretch the Mozzarella the second time. It should look smooth now.
19. Place Mozzarella in a 15% salty water liquid. It should have around 4°C temperature. That way the surface will be closed.
